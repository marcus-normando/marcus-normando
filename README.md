# Notice: Temporary & Non-Professional GitHub Account

This GitHub account is maintained for **temporary, experimental, and learning purposes only**.  
It is not intended to serve as a representation of my professional portfolio, nor does it showcase my production-quality work.  

The repositories you may find here are primarily:  
- Experimental code snippets and prototypes  
- Work-in-progress projects for testing ideas or tools  
- Temporary storage for collaborative or short-term tasks  

For a complete view of my **professional software development work**, including production-grade projects and long-term contributions, please feel free to reach out to me directly or visit my dedicated professional GitHub account (available upon request).  

Thank you for your understanding.
