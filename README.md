# Notice: Temporary & Non-Professional GitHub Account

This GitHub account is maintained for **temporary, experimental, and learning purposes only**.  
It is not intended to serve as a representation of my professional portfolio, nor does it showcase my production-quality work.  

The repositories you may find here are primarily:  
- Experimental code snippets and prototypes  
- Work-in-progress projects for testing ideas or tools  
- Temporary storage for collaborative or contract-based projects

Mainly worked in Company repositories, if you want to find out more about the projects I 've launched so far, feel free to reach out
